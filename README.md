## Overview

Nitric provides a command-line interface (CLI) to assist with various tasks when building applications with the Nitric framework. For more information, check out the main [Nitric repo](https://github.com/nitrictech/nitric).

## Installation

The Nitric CLI is free to [download and install](https://nitric.io/docs/installation).

## Purpose

The Nitric CLI performs 3 main tasks:

- Create new projects
- Run apps locally for testing and development
- Deploy to the cloud you choose

## Common Commands

Common commands in the CLI that youâ€™ll be using:

- nitric down : Undeploy a previously deployed stack, deleting resources
- nitric run : Run your project locally for development and testing
- nitric stack new [stackName] [providerName] : Create a new Nitric stack
- nitric start : Run nitric services locally for development and testing
- nitric up : Create or update a deployed stack

## Help with Commands

Each command is self documented and provides a "help" interface describing the usage, arguments and options for the command. Use the help command to view the help information for any other command:

Example displaying help for the `new` command

```bash
nitric new --help
```
