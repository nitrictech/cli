## About Nitric

This is a [Nitric](https://nitric.io) TypeScript project, but Nitric is a framework for rapid development of cloud-native and serverless applications in many languages.

Using Nitric you define your apps in terms of the resources they need, then write the code for serverless function based APIs, event subscribers and scheduled jobs.

Apps built with Nitric can be deployed to AWS, Azure or Google Cloud all from the same code base so you can focus on your products, not your cloud provider.

Nitric makes it easy to:

- Create smart [serverless functions and APIs](https://nitric.io/docs/apis)
- Build reliable distributed apps that use [events](https://nitric.io/docs/messaging/topics) and/or [queues](https://nitric.io/docs/messaging/queues)
- Securely store, retrieve and rotate [secrets](https://nitric.io/docs/secrets)
- Read and write files from [buckets](https://nitric.io/docs/storage)

## Learning Nitric
